## Graphical Interfaces and Visualization

* <a href="https://www.tensortrace.com">TensorTrace</a><br/>
  TensorTrace is an application that facilitates the design and 
  implementation of tensor network algorithms. Among many other features,
  TensorTrace can automatically determine the optimal contraction sequence and 
  cost scaling for each network, and generate code (in MATLAB, Python or Julia languages) 
  for contracting the tensor networks numerically.
* <a href="https://guitenet.github.io">GuiTeNet</a><br/>
  GuiTeNet lets you construct tensor networks directly in the web browser, and
  apply basic operations like contraction and splitting.
  GuiTeNet simultaneously generates Python/NumPy code for these operations.

  The Tensor Toolbox is a MATLAB library supporting multiple tensor types, 
  including dense, sparse, and symmetric tensors as well as specially 
  structured tensors, such as Tucker format,
  and others. Tensors can be manipulated using MATLAB's object-oriented features.
   
* <a href="https://github.com/jemisjoky/TorchMPS">TorchMPS</a> (Python)<br/>
  TorchMPS is a framework for working with matrix product state (also known 
  as MPS or tensor train) models within Pytorch. Our MPS models are written as 
  Pytorch Modules, and can simply be viewed as differentiable black boxes 
  that are interchangeable with standard neural network layers. However, 
  the rich structure of MPS's allows for more interesting behavior...
